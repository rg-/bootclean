# Wordpress "Bootclean" Theme

Version 9.0.3

```
A complete All-in-One Framework Wordpress Theme
```

## Description

Bootclean is developed with just the index.php template part included. Templates used for diferent wp parts, single, page, taxonomy, etc, are based on a Template Part Layout Structure that can be managed using filters or via Options Theme on admin side.

The main idea here is to use child themes to create custom settings, defaults settings, options and which template to use for home, blog, page, post, and so on.

The other main feature is that everything can be used with shortcodes and those shortcodes can be used with ajax actions.

Bootstrap included and custom sass ready to customize and compile for child themes.

## Features included

- Bootstrap 4 (with many addons)
- jQuery (with many customs: inview scroll, parallax, ajax load, ajax lazyload...)
- Custom Login/Brand
